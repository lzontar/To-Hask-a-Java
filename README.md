# To-Hask-a-Java
## :bulb: What's the idea?
In few words, our main goal is to develop a simple compiler that will take as an input a program written in Java and output an executable file. Due to its simplicity to process tree structures, processing will be done in Haskell.

## Libraries and toolset
#### Haskell
As mentioned above, compiler is based on [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) programming language.

**Haskell** is a general purpose purely functional programming language. It is based on lambda calculus and due to its distinctiveness to other languages it allows you to develop clearer code with fewer errors and higher reliability.

## Project structure
- **Main.hs** contains the main Haskell function which processes program's IO and connects other modules in a single file.
